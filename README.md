# Arduino_StepperMotor_28BYJ-48
Code for stepper motor (28BYJ-48) controlling with Arduino UNO

You need to enter the angle you want the stepper motor to rotate.
It the print out the angle, and the steps as well.
The stepper motor will rotate clockwise if the entered angle is positive, anticlockwise if the entered abgle is negative.

I modified it. It got more simple, with less variables.

In the end, I made it a library called "Stepmotor". You can include <Stepmotor.h> to use it.
I also provided a sample, which uses my library. Enjoy.
